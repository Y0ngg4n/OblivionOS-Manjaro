# OblivionOS | Manjaro Version
This is a Manjaro Spinnoff with minimum changes to achieve a Mac Desktop like Look.
It uses KDE and the WhiteSur Themes available on the KDE Store and Latte Dock.

!!! Be aware this is highly Alpha !!!
I created this Distro for my own because i sucked to always customize my KDE Desktop
